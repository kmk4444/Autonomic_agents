# Autonomic_agents
We will develop basic agent apps for react, opeanai,crewai and autogen.
In the context of language models, the term "agent" typically refers to an independent component within artificial intelligence systems or software that is designed to perform specific tasks. These agents are capable of gathering information, analyzing it, making decisions, and performing certain actions to serve a particular purpose.

Agents can perform the following functions:

1. **Information Gathering**: Collecting information from the environment or data sources.
2. **Analysis and Decision Making**: Analyzing the collected information and making decisions.
3. **Action Execution**: Taking actions to accomplish specific tasks.
4. **Interaction**: Interacting with other agents or users.

In the context of language models, agents are often used in the following ways:

- **Chatbots**: Interacting with users in natural language to answer questions and handle requests.
- **Information Retrieval Agents**: Gathering and presenting information on specific topics.
- **Translation Agents**: Translating texts from one language to another.
- **Text Generation Agents**: Creating texts based on specific topics or requests.

These agents leverage the capabilities of language models to respond to user requests and automate various tasks, thereby enhancing efficiency.
